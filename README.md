## Poem Summary
#### "Broken Wings" is a raw and powerful exploration of trauma, domestic betrayal, and the struggle for freedom. Utilizing bird imagery, the poem depicts a subject whose "wings" are broken by a cycle of patriarchal control and unhealed wounds. It explores the painful reality of a home that is no longer a "safe place" and the silence imposed on victims who feel they have no voice in the world.
